## How It Works üí´üéóÔ∏è
Start the Game

Launch the app and choose a game mode: single-player, two-player, or online multiplayer.
Choose Settings

Select your symbol ("X" or "O") and, for single-player mode, the difficulty level of the AI opponent.
Gameplay

Players take turns marking their symbols in the 3√ó3 grid.
The objective is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
Game End

The game ends when:
A player achieves a line of three symbols (win).
The grid is full without a winner (draw).
A message is displayed with the result (win/draw) and an option to restart.
Score Keeping

Wins, losses, and draws are recorded for each player.
In multiplayer mode, the leaderboard updates based on player performance.
Exit or Restart

Players can exit the game or restart for a new round at any time.
